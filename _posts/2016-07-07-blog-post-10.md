Today in IT we finally got our micro.bits and uploaded code onto them. HOORAY! After we had uploaded the code onto them, we started talking about uses of social media and the internet. After that, wee talked about what we are scared of. I was scared of clicking on pop-up ads that took me somewhere i didn't want to be. Overall, good lesson.
